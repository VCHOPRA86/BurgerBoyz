# Project Feedback Review

In the final stages of the project, I received feedback from friends & family. 
The feedback on the website and documentation was positive overall.  Feedback included changing the color of the paragraphs from #999 to #2b2828 as some found it hard to read. Making the logo a clickable link back to the home page. Adding a'Back to Top' button visible on all screen sizes. All have been implemented


# Bugs

- Issue found on width size 360px with the Hamburger was out of alignment. Issue was fixed by changing the padding size.

- Issues found on width size 280px with the logo being to large and the newsletter info button was overflowing outside of the max width. Both issues were fixed by reducing the font size of the logo and by changing the padding to 0.
