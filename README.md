# Milestone One

### Code Institute: User-Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project



## BurgerBoyz - [Live Site](https://vchopra86.github.io/BurgerBoyz-milestone-project-one/)

## Project Overview
This project is a website for a fictional restaurant named "Burger Boyz" for submission as milestone project 1 as part of the Code Institute - Diploma in Software Development (Full stack) course.

The main aim of this project is to construct an aesthetic, easily-navigable, responsive and 
modern website which greatly helps the marketing potential of the newly opened restaurant. 
It will be constructed using HTML, CSS & Bootstrap 4 web coding methods.

The website showcases the restaurants Home Page, About Us Page, Menu Page and a Contact Us Page which allows the user to fill in a form.

The repository on Github that contains the website source code and assets is available at the following url: [Code Repository](https://github.com/VCHOPRA86/BurgerBoyz-milestone-project-one)

The website was built with a responsive look and feel for desktop, tablet and mobile devices![Responsive site example](assets/readme/screenshot-techsini-home.png)

## Website Owner Business Goals

The main goal for the business owner is to have this website 
serve as an online hub of information for prospective new customers, to engage 
new customers and provide all the necessary information such as business location, menus served, and easy to find contact methods.


### First-time Users


* "As a new user I want to easily find all the necessary information that one would expect when viewing a restaurant website."

* "As a new customer I want to see the restaurant's social presence."

* "As an event promoter I want to contact the restaurant about hosting an event there."

* "As a new/returning user I want to be able to quickly access the menu section of the site to view what particular foods are available."

* "As a new/returning customer I wish to be notified by newsletter about the latest deals, upcoming events & staying up to date with the restaurant."

* "As a new customer I want to know about upcoming events held at the restaurant."

* "As a new user I want to easily find the contact methods & opening times if they need to ask business about extra information"
